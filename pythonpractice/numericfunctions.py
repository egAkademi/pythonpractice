# Numeric Functions


# To find the maximum or minimum of some numbers or a list, you can use max or min.
# To find the distance of a number from zero (its absolute value), use abs.
# To round a number to a certain number of decimal places, use round.
# To find the total of a list, use sum.
# Some examples:

print(min(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1))
print(max([1, 4, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8]))
print(abs(-99))
print(abs(42))
print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

a=min([sum([11, 22]), max(abs(-30), 2)])
print(a)
